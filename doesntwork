Saying something "doesn't work" helps neither you or us. Explain what you *want* to do, what you are *doing* and how it is *failing*. Being abstract or vague doesn't help. Copy/paste the commands that fail and the errors they produce. Consider set -x for a better diagnosis of what is actually going wrong.
