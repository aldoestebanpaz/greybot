''set -x'' (or ''bash -x yourscript'') makes bash output the command name and arguments that it will run (after all parsing and expansion has been applied). Set it by starting a script with ''bash -x ./myscript'' or putting ''set -x'' before the code to debug. ''set +x'' turns this off. To add more information, set PS4: PS4=':${BASH_SOURCE}:${FUNCNAME}:${LINENO}+'
