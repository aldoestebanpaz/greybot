Please do NOT waste our time by making us go to a pastebin just for a stupid little 5-line snippet. Paste it in the channel. If you have a larger script that's showing problems, for fuck's sake, TRIM IT DOWN to the bare minimum size that still shows the problem. You'll probably fix it yourself once you do that.
