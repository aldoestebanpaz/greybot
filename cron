Cron is used for scheduling recurring jobs. at(1) is used for scheduling a job to run once at a given date. crontab -e, /etc/crontab or /etc/periodic are places where you can configure jobs. The most common problems with cron jobs are using %'s in a crontab (must be escaped, either doubled: date +%%Y or backslash: date +\%Y) and having a different environment (eg. PATH/SHELL). See man 5 crontab
