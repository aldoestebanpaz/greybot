Some sed(1)s have a -i flag that claims to "modify" files. It does not: sed is NOT A FILE editor, its -i flag re-writes the entire file and then replaces the original with the new. This causes problems, including breaking open handles and symlinks. Worse, -i is very unportable: a valid sed on one system will write broken files on another. Use ed(1), vi(1) or ex(1) instead: eg. ex -sc '%s/a/b/|wq'
