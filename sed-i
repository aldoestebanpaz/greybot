Some sed(1)s have a -i flag that allow you to "modify" files. Sed is NOT A FILE EDITOR: its -i flag does not edit a file, it deletes and re-writes it. This has many problems, including breaking open handles and symlinks. Worse, -i usage is very unportable: your command can do very bad things on other systems. Use ed(1), vi(1) or ex(1) instead!
