echo outputs a string. It is non-portable except in very simple cases, and should never be used with option flags. In POSIX shells, use: `printf '%b\n' "args"' or `printf %s "args"' for echo -e and -n respectively. For ksh-like shells other than Bash, use print -[r|n]. http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/commands/builtin/echo | http://cfajohnson.com/shell/cus-faq.html#Q0b |
