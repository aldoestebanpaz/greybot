$var; rm $file -- If you do not quote $var bash will split its content up into words, *removing* ALL whitespace (newlines, spaces, tabs) from it. Each word is fed as a separate argument to echo or rm. Echo prints all its arguments separating them by a SINGLE space while rm will remove the files denoted by every WORD.
