echo outputs a string. echo has many portability problems, and should never be used with option flags. In POSIX shells, use: `printf '%b\n' "args"' or `printf %s "args"' for -e and -n respectively. For ksh-like shells other than Bash: print -[r|n]. http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/commands/builtin/echo | http://cfajohnson.com/shell/cus-faq.html#Q0b | http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/echo+printf
