What is the *REAL* (non-technical) problem or issue you are trying to address? Describe it clearly and concisely using little or no technical terminology, command names, etc. If providing sample data, make it either real or realistic (if something is a product name, and you must anonymize, call it "Foo Widgets", not xxxxx; if it has 3 fields, provide 3 fields, don't simplify to 2; etc).
