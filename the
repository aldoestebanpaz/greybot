''for var in words'' compound command iterates over arguments. ''for ((i=0; i < n; i++))'' iterates over a numeric range. To iterate over filenames, use ''for file in [glob]''. Do *NOT* do ''for foo in `cat,ls,find,...`'ere, for will iterate over resulting WORDS, NOT the "filenames", or "lines" that the command outputs.
