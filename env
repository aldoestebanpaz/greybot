Environment Variables (`env`) are NOT the same thing as Bash Parameters (`set`). They are NOT GLOBAL (every process has their own set of env vars), and they are only ever copied from the PARENT to the CHILD when the child is CREATED. You cannot UPDATE another process' variables. Bash lets you assign STRINGs to its own env vars by linking a parameter to its environment using "export".
