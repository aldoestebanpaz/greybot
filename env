Environment Variables (`env`) are NOT the same thing as Bash Parameters (`declare -p`). They are NOT GLOBAL (every process has their own), and they are COPIED from the PARENT when the child process is CREATED. You CANNOT UPDATE another process' variables. You can assign strings to your OWN environment by linking a parameter to it using "export". http://mywiki.wooledge.org/Environment
