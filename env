Environment Variables (`env`) are NOT the same thing as Bash Parameters (`set`). They are NOT GLOBAL (every process has their own set of env vars), and they are only ever copied from the PARENT to the CHILD when the child is FIRST CREATED. Bash lets you assign STRINGs to env vars by linking a parameter to the environment using `export`.
