Google, albeit a very respectable search engine, is NOT a good source of Bash information. Mostly due to the fact that 90% of the bash "tutorials" and "scripts" out there are absolute JUNK. Refer to http://wooledge.org/mywiki/BashGuide and http://wooledge.org/mywiki/BashFAQ instead or ask your questions here.
