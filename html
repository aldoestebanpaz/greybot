You can't realistically parse tag-based markup languages like HTML and XML using bash or utilities such as grep, sed or cut. If you just want to dump/render HTML, see (lynx|elinks|links|links2|w8m) -dump, html2text, vilistextum. For parsing out pieces of data, see tidy + (xmlstarlet|xmlgawk|xpath|xml2), or learn xslt. Ask #xml and #html for more help. See http://xrl.us/bkrxog and http://xrl.us/p0ny
