You can't realistically parse tag-based markup languages like HTML and XML using Bash or utilities such as grep, sed or cut. If you just want to dump/render HTML, see (links|links2|lynx|w3m) -dump, html2text, vilistextum. For parsing out pieces of data, see tidy+(xmlstarlet|xmlgawk|xpath), or learn xslt. Ask #xml and #html for more help.
