Always avoid injecting data into code. Only EVER combine two strings when you're CERTAIN they are of the same context. Eg. do NOT put data and code together in a bash/mysql/sed/... command. Try /msg greybot ![lang]quote to learn how to convert literal data into [lang] code for safe injection. (eg. !shquote, !requote)
