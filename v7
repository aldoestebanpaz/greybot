Seventh Edition Unix (V7), released in 1979, is the common ancestor of both BSD and System V, and marked the appearance of the Bourne Shell, which replaced the earlier Thompson Shell. If your script needs to work on pre-POSIX Unix systems, the features of v7 are a good least common denominator of nearly all Unix systems. A full tree of V7, including source and manpages, may be found at http://minnie.tuhs.org/UnixTree/V7/usr/ .
