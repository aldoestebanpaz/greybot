We are here to discuss the specifics of coding with bash. We might discuss #sed #awk or grep as well as tr, cut, join and paste (man -k is your friend) but this is about BASH scripting, on any platform. If you want to discuss another shell, please chat to us in ##bashers. NB some of us get very annoyed about random talk about other stuff.
