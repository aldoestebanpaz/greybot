We are here to discuss the specifics of coding with bash. We might discuss #sed #awk or grep as well as tr, cut, join and paste (man -k is your friend) but this is about bash, on various platforms. If you want to discuss another shell, please chat to us in #bashers. (And yes, you have ops. Don't ask.)
