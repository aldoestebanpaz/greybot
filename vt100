ANSI X3.64 is a terminal control code standard supported by most modern terminals. VT100 is a subset implemented by DEC's VT100/102. DO NOT hardcode codes, use tput(1) instead. There are many different terminals and that use slightly different codes. http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/5802 http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/terminalcodes
