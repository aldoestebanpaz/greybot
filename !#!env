In addition to having exec permission, the top of a script MUST have a #! line, called 'shebang' or 'hashbang'. It tells the kernel what program to run your script with. Make sure you adjust it to match where the appropriate version of Bash is installed on your system;. If your system does not have bash installed at /bin/bash you will likely have to adjust any scripts you receive.
