ASCII zero, the null byte, aka 'NUL' is the best delimiter for lists of strings (eg. file names). However, there isn't much you can do with it in portable scripts. Bash can read null-byte delimited input with "while IFS= read -d ''; do ... ". Bash cannot, however, store or pass a null byte as parameter. To get Bash to output a NUL, you can use echo -e '\0', NOT echo $'\0'. tr(1) can process NULs portably, though
