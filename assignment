To assign to a variable, use varname=value . Do not include spaces around the '=', and do not write $varname on the left hand side. The value must be a word (quote funny characters), but it does not undergo word-splitting or globbing. Assign to an array with arr=( value1 value2 ) (which does undergo word-splitting and globbing), or an array element with arr[i+1]=value . See also: declare, local, and export.
