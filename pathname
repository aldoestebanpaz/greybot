pathnames are parsed left to right, split into components separated by "/"; if the first such component is empty (and there is more than one) then it starts in the root directory, otherwise it starts in the current directory. If a component is "." or empty, then it does not move; if a component is ".." it moves up to the parent directory; otherwise it moves into the subdirectory named therein. Except the last component can be any type
