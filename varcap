By convention, we capitalize environment variables (PAGER, EDITOR, ..) and internal shell variables (SHELL, BASH_VERSION, ..). All other variable names should contain at least one lower case letter. Remember that variable names are case-sensitive; this convention avoids accidentally overriding environmental and internal variables.
