Setting the -x option on bash enables a debugging mode that makes bash output the command name and arguments that it will run (after all parsing and expansion has been applied). Set it by starting a script with ''bash -x ./myscript'' or putting ''set -x'' before the code you want to debug. ''set +x'' turns this behaviour off.
