<<<"$(command)" is pointless. It creates multiple temp files, requires the entire command to run before passing it to stdin, and removes trailing newlines from the command's output. Without the quotes, it's even worse; wordsplitting occurs and all whitespace gets squeezed to single spaces. Process substition was created for doing this efficiently and correctly.
