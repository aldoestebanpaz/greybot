Alias expansion is a text macro that prepends to a simple command when the command's first word is the name of a defined alias by substituting that word with the alias's value. Aliases are only enabled in interactive and POSIX modes by default. They don't take arguments or behave like functions. Almost always, use functions instead of aliases. Ex: ls() { command ls --color=auto "$@"; }
