A healthy ego is essential. Please, however, do not let yours get in the way of us helping you. Try to answer our questions, and type the commands we give you, when we give them to you. You will have more questions; try and answer them yourself by reading any docs mentioned, then ask us. And please, don't get defensive, or lecture others who are helping you. We'll try to do the same :D
