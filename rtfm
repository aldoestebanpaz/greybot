Read The Fucking Manual: http://tiswww.tis.case.edu/~chet/bash/bash.html | Start by reading Description, then skip to and read Arguments, then skip Invocation and begin reading from Definitions through to Prompting, then skip Readline and begin again with History through to the end, at which point you can return to read Options, Invocation and Readline. Then ask again :)
