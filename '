There are two kinds of quotes; '' and "". Both have a very distinct function. '' prevents any evaluation of its content by bash. That INCLUDES backslash-escaping; so '\'' will NOT escape the inner '. "" does the same thing as '', in that it keeps its content together to be passed as one argument; however, it DOES allow for parameter expansion and escaping. eg. "I'd have told $USER: \"Read man bash already!\".".
